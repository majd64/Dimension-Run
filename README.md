# Dimension-Run
#### This is THE project that made me want to become a developer. A 2D side scroller with 4 distinct levels, 3 boss fights, and a final boss that uses artificial intelligence to guide its movement, avoid the player's bullets and fight back. Created for the ICS3U final project. 

##### This game was created in a group of 3: myself, Alex Mackay and Rohan Talukdar.
